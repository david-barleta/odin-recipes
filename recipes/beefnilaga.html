        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><em>This is another one-meal-in-a-pot dish. It contains soup, meat and vegetables all cooked together in one delicious broth. Terrific during cooler weather. Serve hot alone or with rice.</em></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 and 1/2 pounds beef short ribs</li>
                <li>1 quart water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon black peppercorns, crushed</li>
                <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
                <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
                <li>2 carrots, cut in chunks</li>
                <li>2 stalks celery, quartered</li>
                <li>1 chayote squash, peeled and quartered</li>
                <li>2 potatoes, quartered</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 head cabbage, cut into wedges</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the beef ribs in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, and boil for 5 minutes. Drain; discard the cooking water (the ribs will not be fully cooked).</li>
                <li>Return the beef to the pot. Pour in the 1 quart water, peppercorns, onions, and beef bouillon. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Skim any fat floating on the surface. Stir in the carrots, celery, chayote, and potatoes; cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Season with salt. Add cabbage and cook an additional 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
